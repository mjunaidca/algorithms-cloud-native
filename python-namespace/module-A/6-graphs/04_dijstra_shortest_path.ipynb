    "Dijkstra's algorithm is indeed a powerful tool for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph, particularly when all edge weights are non-negative. Let's break down the key concepts you touched on and then dive into implementing Dijkstra's algorithm in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that computes the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. The algorithm maintains a set of nodes whose shortest distance from the source is known and iteratively expands this set by selecting the node with the minimum distance from the source, updating the distances to its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Algorithm Steps**\n",
    "1. **Initialize:**\n",
    "   - Create a distance array (`dist`) and set all distances to infinity (`∞`), except the distance to the source node, which is set to 0.\n",
    "   - Create a previous node array (`prev`) to store the previous node on the shortest path.\n",
    "   - Create a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the node with the smallest distance that hasn't been fully processed.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Processing Nodes:**\n",
    "   - While there are nodes to process (nodes in the priority queue):\n",
    "     - Extract the node with the smallest distance (let's call it `u`).\n",
    "     - For each neighbor `v` of `u`, calculate the potential new distance `dist[u] + weight(u, v)`.\n",
    "     - If this new distance is smaller than `dist[v]`, update `dist[v]` and set `prev[v]` to `u`.\n",
    "     - If `v` is updated, add it to the priority queue with the new distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Terminate:**\n",
    "   - The algorithm terminates when all nodes have been processed or the priority queue is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reconstruct the Shortest Path:**\n",
    "   - To find the shortest path from the source to any node `t`, trace back from `t` using the `prev` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Python Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can implement Dijkstra's algorithm in Python using an adjacency list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import heapq\n",
    "\n",
    "def dijkstra(graph, source):\n",
    "    # Step 1: Initialize distances and previous node arrays\n",

    "        # Step 3: Extract the node with the smallest distance\n",
    "        current_dist, u = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Step 4: Process each neighbor of the current node\n",
    "        for neighbor, weight in graph[u].items():\n",
    "            distance = current_dist + weight\n",
    "            # Step 5: If a shorter path to the neighbor is found\n",
    "            if distance < dist[neighbor]:\n",
    "                dist[neighbor] = distance\n",
    "                prev[neighbor] = u\n",

    "### 4. **Explanation of the Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: We start by initializing the distance for each node to infinity, except for the source node, which is set to 0. The `prev` array is used to reconstruct the shortest path later.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Priority Queue**: We use a priority queue to keep track of the node with the smallest distance to process next. The `heapq` module is used for this, which provides an efficient way to manage the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Processing Nodes**: For each node `u`, we update the distances to its neighbors `v` if we find a shorter path through `u`. If a shorter path is found, we update `prev[v]` to point to `u`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shortest Path Reconstruction**: After running the algorithm, we can reconstruct the shortest path from the source to any target node by backtracking through the `prev` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Understanding Dijkstra’s Algorithm Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra's algorithm has a time complexity of \\(O((V + E) \\log V)\\) when using a priority queue (min-heap). This is an improvement over the original \\(O(V^2)\\) implementation due to better data structures, like the min-heap for efficiently extracting the minimum element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Running the Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example provided, the graph is defined as an adjacency list where each node has a dictionary of its neighbors with corresponding edge weights. The algorithm is run from a specified source node, and the shortest path to a target node is reconstructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This explanation and implementation should give you a solid foundation for understanding Dijkstra's algorithm and how it works. If you have any questions or want to explore further optimizations, feel free to ask!"
