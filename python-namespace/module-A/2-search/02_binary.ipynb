    "## Pitfalls of Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tSorted List Requirement:\n",
    "\t•\tBinary search requires the list to be sorted beforehand. If the list is not sorted, the algorithm will not work correctly.\n",
    "\t•\tSorting the list adds additional overhead, especially for large datasets. Sorting itself has a time complexity of O(n \\log n).\n",
    "\t2.\tInteger Overflow:\n",
    "\t•\tIn languages with fixed integer sizes, calculating the midpoint as (low + high) // 2 can cause integer overflow. This is usually not a concern in Python due to its handling of large integers, but it’s a potential pitfall in other languages like C++ or Java.\n",
    "\t•\tA safer way to calculate the midpoint is low + (high - low) // 2.\n",
    "\t3.\tInfinite Loops:\n",
    "\t•\tIncorrect updates to the low and high pointers can cause infinite loops. Ensuring that low and high are updated correctly in each iteration is crucial.\n",
    "\t4.\tEdge Cases:\n",
    "\t•\tHandling edge cases like an empty list or a list with one element can be tricky and needs special attention.\n",
    "\t•\tIf the target element is smaller than the smallest element or larger than the largest element, the algorithm needs to terminate correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Binary Search Differs from Linear Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tLinear Search: Time complexity is O(n). It checks each element sequentially until the target is found or the list ends. This makes it inefficient for large lists.\n",
    "\t•\tBinary Search: Time complexity is O(\\log n). It divides the search interval in half with each step, significantly reducing the number of comparisons needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applicability:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tLinear Search: Can be applied to any list, whether sorted or unsorted.\n",
    "\t•\tBinary Search: Only applicable to sorted lists. If the list is unsorted, it must be sorted first, adding overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tLinear Search: Simple to implement. Iterate through the list and check each element.\n",
    "\t•\tBinary Search: More complex. Requires careful management of pointers and calculation of the midpoint.\n"
