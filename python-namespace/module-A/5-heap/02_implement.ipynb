    "### Heap Explained Like You're 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, let’s imagine you have a big pile of toys, and you want to always be able to grab the smallest toy quickly. To do this, you arrange your toys in a special way, called a **Min-Heap**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Min-Heap?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Min-Heap** is like a magic toy box where the smallest toy is always on top.\n",
    "- Whenever you add a new toy, you put it in a spot that keeps your magic toy box in order, so the smallest toy stays on top.\n",
    "- When you take the smallest toy out, the box rearranges itself to make sure the next smallest toy is on top.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does it Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inserting a New Toy**:\n",
    "   - You add the toy to the bottom of the pile.\n",
    "   - If this new toy is smaller than the one above it, you swap them.\n",
    "   - You keep swapping until the toy is in the right spot, and the smallest toy is still on top.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Removing the Smallest Toy**:\n",
    "   - You take the smallest toy from the top.\n",
    "   - Then, you take the last toy from the bottom and move it to the top.\n",
    "   - If this toy isn’t the smallest anymore, you swap it with its smaller child until the heap is correct again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's Implement the Min-Heap!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s create our Min-Heap using some simple code. Don’t worry—it’s like organizing your toys step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Set Up the Heap\n",
    "We’re going to use an array (a simple list) to keep track of our toys.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MinHeap:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.heap = []  # This is our toy pile\n",
    "\n",
    "    def insert(self, value):\n",
    "        self.heap.append(value)  # Add the new toy to the end of the pile\n",
    "        self._heapify_up(len(self.heap) - 1)  # Move it to the right spot\n",
    "\n",
    "    def delete(self):\n",
    "        if len(self.heap) == 0:\n",
    "            return None  # If there are no toys, nothing to remove!\n",
    "        \n",
    "        min_value = self.heap[0]  # The smallest toy is on top\n",
    "        self.heap[0] = self.heap.pop()  # Move the last toy to the top\n",
    "        self._heapify_down(0)  # Move the top toy to the right spot\n",
    "        return min_value\n",
    "\n",
    "    def _heapify_up(self, index):\n",
    "        parent_index = (index - 1) // 2\n",
    "        if index > 0 and self.heap[index] < self.heap[parent_index]:\n",
    "            # Swap if the current toy is smaller than the parent\n",
    "            self.heap[index], self.heap[parent_index] = self.heap[parent_index], self.heap[index]\n",
    "            self._heapify_up(parent_index)  # Continue checking upwards\n",
    "\n",
    "    def _heapify_down(self, index):\n",
    "        smallest = index\n",
    "        left_child_index = 2 * index + 1\n",
    "        right_child_index = 2 * index + 2\n",
    "\n",
    "        if left_child_index < len(self.heap) and self.heap[left_child_index] < self.heap[smallest]:\n",
    "            smallest = left_child_index\n",
    "\n",
    "        if right_child_index < len(self.heap) and self.heap[right_child_index] < self.heap[smallest]:\n",
    "            smallest = right_child_index\n",
    "\n",
    "        if smallest != index:\n",
    "            # Swap if the current toy is bigger than the smallest child\n",
    "            self.heap[index], self.heap[smallest] = self.heap[smallest], self.heap[index]\n",
    "            self._heapify_down(smallest)  # Continue checking downwards\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does This Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inserting a Toy**:\n",
    "  - You add the toy at the end of the list and then check if it needs to be swapped with its parent to keep the smallest toy on top.\n",
    "  - This is done by the `_heapify_up` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removing the Smallest Toy**:\n",
    "  - You remove the toy at the top (the smallest one).\n",
    "  - Then you move the last toy to the top and swap it down to its correct place to keep the heap in order.\n",
    "  - This is done by the `_heapify_down` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how you might use this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a new heap\n",
    "min_heap = MinHeap()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add some toys (numbers) to the heap\n",
    "min_heap.insert(10)\n",
    "min_heap.insert(5)\n",
    "min_heap.insert(20)\n",
    "min_heap.insert(3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Take out the smallest toy\n",
    "print(min_heap.delete())  # Output: 3\n",
    "print(min_heap.delete())  # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insert**: You add a toy and move it up to the right spot (`O(log n)` time).\n",
    "- **Delete**: You take the smallest toy, put the last toy on top, and move it down to the right spot (`O(log n)` time).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how you can manage your toys (or numbers) so that the smallest one is always easy to find and take out."
