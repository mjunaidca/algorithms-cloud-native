    "### Understanding Deletion in Binary Search Trees (BSTs)\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with deletion in binary search trees (BSTs), it's important to recognize that there are three main cases, each with its own specific handling. The goal of deletion is to remove a node while preserving the properties of the BST. Here's a breakdown of each case:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Case 1: Node with No Children (Leaf Node)**\n",
    "   - **Description:** The node to be deleted has no children, meaning it is a leaf node.\n",
    "   - **Handling:** Simply remove the node from the tree. Since it has no children, there are no further adjustments needed.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     Before deletion:\n",
    "           5\n",
    "          / \\\n",
    "         3   8\n",
    "              \\\n",
    "               10\n",
    "     Deleting node 10:\n",
    "           5\n",
    "          / \\\n",
    "         3   8\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** In this example, deleting node 10 requires no special handling. It's a leaf node, so it's simply removed, and the BST properties remain intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Case 2: Node with One Child**\n",
    "   - **Description:** The node to be deleted has exactly one child.\n",
    "   - **Handling:** Replace the node to be deleted with its child. This ensures that the BST properties are preserved.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     Before deletion:\n",
    "           5\n",
    "          / \\\n",
    "         3   8\n",
    "              \\\n",
    "               10\n",
    "              /\n",
    "             9\n",
    "     Deleting node 10:\n",
    "           5\n",
    "          / \\\n",
    "         3   8\n",
    "              \\\n",
    "               9\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** In this example, node 10 has one child (node 9). To delete node 10, we simply replace it with its child, node 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Case 3: Node with Two Children**\n",
    "   - **Description:** The node to be deleted has two children.\n",
    "   - **Handling:** This is the most complex case. You can handle it by either:\n",
    "     - **In-Order Predecessor:** Replace the node with the largest value from its left subtree.\n",
    "     - **In-Order Successor:** Replace the node with the smallest value from its right subtree.\n",
    "   - **Steps:**\n",
    "     1. Identify the in-order predecessor or successor.\n",
    "     2. Swap the node to be deleted with the identified node.\n",
    "     3. Recursively delete the swapped node, which will now be either a leaf node or a node with one child, reducing it to Case 1 or Case 2.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```plaintext\n",
    "     Before deletion:\n",
    "           50\n",
    "          /  \\\n",
    "         30   70\n",
    "        / \\   / \\\n",
    "       20 40 60 80\n",
    "     Deleting node 50:\n",
    "           60\n",
    "          /  \\\n",
    "         30   70\n",
    "        / \\     \\\n",
    "       20 40    80\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** To delete node 50, we choose its in-order successor (node 60), replace node 50 with node 60, and then delete node 60 from its original position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Implementation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can implement the deletion process in a BST in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Node:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "        self.left = None\n",
    "        self.right = None\n",
    "\n",
    "class BinarySearchTree:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",

    "\n",
    "    def insert(self, value):\n",
    "        if self.root is None:\n",
    "            self.root = Node(value)\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            self._insert(self.root, value)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def _insert(self, node, value):\n",
    "        if value < node.value:\n",
    "            if node.left is None:\n",
    "                node.left = Node(value)\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                self._insert(node.left, value)\n",

    "        self.root = self._delete(self.root, value)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def _delete(self, node, value):\n",
    "        if node is None:\n",
    "            return node\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Finding the node to delete\n",
    "        if value < node.value:\n",
    "            node.left = self._delete(node.left, value)\n",
    "        elif value > node.value:\n",
    "            node.right = self._delete(node.right, value)\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            # Node with one child or no child\n",
    "            if node.left is None:\n",
    "                return node.right\n",
    "            elif node.right is None:\n",
    "                return node.left\n",
    "            \n",
    "            # Node with two children: get the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree)\n",
    "            temp = self._min_value_node(node.right)\n",
    "            node.value = temp.value\n",
    "            node.right = self._delete(node.right, temp.value)\n",
    "\n",
    "        return node\n",
    "\n",
    "    def _min_value_node(self, node):\n",
    "        current = node\n",
    "        while current.left is not None:\n",
    "            current = current.left\n",
    "        return current\n",
    "\n",
    "    def inorder_traversal(self):\n",
    "        return self._inorder_traversal(self.root, [])\n",
    "\n",
    "    def _inorder_traversal(self, node, values):\n",
    "        if node:\n",
    "            self._inorder_traversal(node.left, values)\n",

    "            self._inorder_traversal(node.right, values)\n",

    "# Example usage:\n",
    "bst = BinarySearchTree()\n",
    "for value in [50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80]:\n",
    "    bst.insert(value)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"In-order traversal before deletion:\", bst.inorder_traversal())\n",
    "\n",
    "bst.delete(50)\n",
    "print(\"In-order traversal after deletion:\", bst.inorder_traversal())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insert Method:**\n",
    "   - This method is straightforward and inserts nodes while maintaining the BST properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Delete Method:**\n",
    "   - The `delete` method finds the node to be deleted and handles it according to the cases discussed.\n",
    "   - The helper method `_min_value_node` finds the in-order successor (the smallest value node in the right subtree).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **In-Order Traversal:**\n",
    "   - This is used to verify the structure of the tree before and after deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Example:\n",
    "When you run the code, it should demonstrate the deletion of the node with two children, showing how the tree maintains its properties even after such deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "In-order traversal before deletion: [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]\n",
    "In-order traversal after deletion: [20, 30, 40, 60, 70, 80]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "Deletion in a binary search tree can be complex, especially when dealing with nodes that have two children. Understanding and implementing the correct steps ensures that the tree's properties are preserved, allowing it to continue functioning efficiently for search operations. The code provided illustrates how these concepts are applied in practice."
