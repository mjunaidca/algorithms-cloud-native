    "To implement Depth-First Search (DFS) using an adjacency list in Python, we'll follow a similar approach to the BFS example, but DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",

    "### 1. **Adjacency List Representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In an adjacency list, each vertex has a list of its adjacent vertices. Here's a simple example graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3\n",
    "- Edges: (0-1), (1-2), (2-3), (3-0)\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjacency list representation for this graph would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "graph = {\n",
    "    0: [1, 3],\n",
    "    1: [0, 2],\n",
    "    2: [1, 3],\n",
    "    3: [0, 2]\n",

    "### 3. **Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursive DFS**: The recursive method uses a function call stack to explore the graph deeply. Starting from a given vertex, it marks the vertex as visited, prints or stores it, and recursively visits each unvisited neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterative DFS**: The iterative method uses an explicit stack data structure. It starts at the given vertex, pushes it onto the stack, and then continually pops vertices from the stack, visiting unvisited neighbors by pushing them onto the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the given graph, both the recursive and iterative implementations should produce a similar DFS order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DFS Order (Recursive)**: `0 1 2 3`\n",
    "- **DFS Order (Iterative)**: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact order can vary depending on the structure of the adjacency list and the order of neighbors in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "These implementations work well for unweighted and simple graphs. If you need to extend these to handle more complex cases, like handling weights, cycles, or directed graphs, you can build upon these basic principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you need any more help or further explanations!"
