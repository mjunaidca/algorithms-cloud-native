    "### Depth-First Search (DFS) Deletion in a Binary Search Tree (BST)\n",
    "\n",
    "Deleting a node from a Binary Search Tree (BST) is one of the more complex operations, especially when compared to insertion and search. The challenge arises because we need to maintain the BST property after the deletion, ensuring that the tree remains properly structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Aspects of Deletion in a BST\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **BST Property Recap**:\n",
    "   - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than or equal to the node's value.\n",
    "   - The right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cases of Node Deletion**:\n",
    "   - **Case 1: The node to be deleted has no children** (it's a leaf node).\n",
    "   - **Case 2: The node to be deleted has one child** (either left or right).\n",
    "   - **Case 3: The node to be deleted has two children** (both left and right).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation and Steps for Each Case\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Case 1: Node has No Children (Leaf Node)**\n",
    "- **Scenario**: The node to be deleted is a leaf, meaning it has no left or right children.\n",
    "- **Action**: Simply remove the node from the tree by setting the appropriate pointer of its parent to `None`.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - Tree before deletion: `25 -> (4, 100)`\n",
    "  - Deleting `4`: The tree after deletion would be `25 -> (X, 100)` where `X` denotes a null pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Case 2: Node has One Child**\n",
    "- **Scenario**: The node to be deleted has either a left child or a right child, but not both.\n",
    "- **Action**: Replace the node with its child. Essentially, you bypass the node by connecting its parent directly to its child.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - Tree before deletion: `25 -> (10, 100)`, with `10 -> (4, X)` (where `X` is null).\n",
    "  - Deleting `10`: The tree after deletion would be `25 -> (4, 100)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Case 3: Node has Two Children**\n",
    "- **Scenario**: The node to be deleted has both left and right children.\n",
    "- **Action**: This is the most complex case. You have two main strategies:\n",
    "  - **Option A: Replace with the in-order predecessor** (the largest value in the left subtree).\n",
    "  - **Option B: Replace with the in-order successor** (the smallest value in the right subtree).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  After selecting one of these strategies, you swap the values and then recursively delete the predecessor or successor (which will be in case 1 or 2 since it cannot have two children).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - Tree before deletion: `50 -> (25, 75)`, `25 -> (15, 30)`, `75 -> (60, 80)`.\n",
    "  - Deleting `50`: You might replace `50` with `30` (in-order predecessor) or `60` (in-order successor).\n",
    "  - Assume we choose the in-order predecessor (`30`), you would then replace `50` with `30`, and the tree now needs to delete `30` from its original position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pseudocode for Deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the pseudocode for the delete operation in a BST:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def delete_node(node, value):\n",
    "    # Base case: if the node is null, return null\n",
    "    if node is None:\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # If the value to be deleted is smaller than the node's value, go to the left subtree\n",
    "    if value < node.value:\n",
    "        node.left = delete_node(node.left, value)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # If the value to be deleted is greater than the node's value, go to the right subtree\n",
    "    elif value > node.value:\n",
    "        node.right = delete_node(node.right, value)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # If the value is equal to the node's value, this is the node to be deleted\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # Case 1: Node has no children\n",
    "        if node.left is None and node.right is None:\n",
    "            return None\n",

    "        elif node.right is None:\n",
    "            return node.left\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Case 3: Node has two children\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            # Option A: Get the in-order predecessor (max value in the left subtree)\n",
    "            predecessor = get_max(node.left)\n",
    "            node.value = predecessor.value\n",
    "            node.left = delete_node(node.left, predecessor.value)\n",
    "            \n",
    "            # Option B: Alternatively, you can get the in-order successor (min value in the right subtree)\n",
    "            # successor = get_min(node.right)\n",
    "            # node.value = successor.value\n",
    "            # node.right = delete_node(node.right, successor.value)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return node\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_max(node):\n",
    "    while node.right is not None:\n",
    "        node = node.right\n",

    "### Time Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Best-Case Scenario**:\n",
    "   - **Scenario**: The tree is balanced, and the node to be deleted is found at the root or close to the root.\n",
    "   - **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: In a balanced BST, the height `h` is `O(log n)`, so deletion operations take `O(log n)` time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Average-Case Scenario**:\n",
    "   - **Scenario**: The tree is balanced, and the node is somewhere in the middle levels.\n",
    "   - **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)`.\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: Most operations in a balanced tree will still be `O(log n)` because of the logarithmic height.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Worst-Case Scenario**:\n",
    "   - **Scenario**: The tree is unbalanced (e.g., a skewed tree), and the node to be deleted is deep in the tree.\n",
    "   - **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: In an unbalanced tree, the height can be `O(n)`, making the deletion time complexity linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursive Implementation**:\n",
    "  - **Space Complexity**: `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the tree.\n",
    "  - **Explanation**: The recursion stack depth is proportional to the height of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterative Implementation**:\n",
    "  - **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` if implemented iteratively, but managing deletion iteratively can be more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Considerations: Balancing the Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tree Height and Efficiency**: After multiple insertions and deletions, a BST can become unbalanced, leading to degraded performance. It's crucial to consider tree balancing techniques, such as AVL trees or Red-Black trees, which maintain a more optimal tree height after deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Deleting a node in a BST is the most complex operation due to the need to maintain the BST properties while properly restructuring the tree. The operation involves several cases, each with specific handling. The time complexity of the deletion operation is heavily influenced by the height of the tree, which can range from `O(log n)` in a balanced tree to `O(n)` in the worst case of an unbalanced tree. Understanding and correctly implementing these cases is crucial for maintaining efficient operations in a BST."
