    "### Tries Explained Like You're 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're playing a game with your friends where you want to find words really fast. You have a special tree-like structure called a **Trie** (pronounced \"try\") to help you do this!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Trie?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Trie** is like a tree that helps you store words, letter by letter.\n",
    "- Each path from the top (root) of the tree to a node represents a word or part of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does a Trie Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adding a Word**:\n",
    "   - Start at the top of the tree.\n",
    "   - For each letter in the word, move down to the next level of the tree.\n",
    "   - If there’s already a branch for that letter, use it. If not, create a new branch.\n",
    "   - When you’ve added all the letters, mark the end of the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Finding a Word**:\n",
    "   - Start at the top of the tree.\n",
    "   - For each letter in the word, move down the tree.\n",
    "   - If you reach the end of the word and there’s a special marker, it means the word is in the tree!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Autocomplete**:\n",
    "   - You can also use a Trie to find all words that start with a certain prefix (like \"ca\" to find \"cat,\" \"car,\" and \"cake\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is a Trie Cool?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It helps you find words really fast.\n",
    "- It saves space because words that share the same starting letters share the same path in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let’s Build a Simple Trie!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a little code to create and use a Trie. Don’t worry if it looks a bit like magic—just think of it as building and searching through your word tree!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create the Trie\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TrieNode:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.children = {}  # Each node has a dictionary of children\n",
    "        self.is_end_of_word = False  # This flag tells us if a word ends here\n",
    "\n",
    "class Trie:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.root = TrieNode()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def insert(self, word):\n",
    "        current = self.root\n",
    "        for letter in word:\n",
    "            if letter not in current.children:\n",
    "                current.children[letter] = TrieNode()\n",
    "            current = current.children[letter]\n",
    "        current.is_end_of_word = True  # Mark the end of the word\n",
    "\n",
    "    def search(self, word):\n",
    "        current = self.root\n",
    "        for letter in word:\n",
    "            if letter not in current.children:\n",
    "                return False\n",
    "            current = current.children[letter]\n",
    "        return current.is_end_of_word  # Check if we're at the end of a word\n",
    "\n",
    "    def starts_with(self, prefix):\n",
    "        current = self.root\n",
    "        for letter in prefix:\n",
    "            if letter not in current.children:\n",
    "                return False\n",
    "            current = current.children[letter]\n",
    "        return True  # We can find all words that start with this prefix\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does This Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insert**: You add a word to the Trie by following or creating branches for each letter. When you finish, you mark the end of the word.\n",
    "- **Search**: You look for a word by following the branches for each letter. If you get to the end of the word and the end is marked, the word is in the Trie!\n",
    "- **Starts With**: You check if any words in the Trie start with a certain prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's play with our Trie:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a new Trie\n",
    "trie = Trie()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add some words\n",
    "trie.insert(\"cat\")\n",
    "trie.insert(\"car\")\n",
    "trie.insert(\"cake\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Search for words\n",
    "print(trie.search(\"cat\"))  # Output: True (cat is in the Trie)\n",
    "print(trie.search(\"cap\"))  # Output: False (cap is not in the Trie)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if a prefix exists\n",
    "print(trie.starts_with(\"ca\"))  # Output: True (cat, car, and cake start with \"ca\")\n",
    "print(trie.starts_with(\"co\"))  # Output: False (no words start with \"co\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Trie** helps you store and find words really fast.\n",
    "- It’s like a tree where each branch is a letter, and paths down the tree represent words.\n",
    "- Tries are great for things like autocomplete, spell checking, and quick word searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a Trie as a magical word tree where you can easily find any word or see all the words that start with certain letters. It's like having a super-organized dictionary!"
