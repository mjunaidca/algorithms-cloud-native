    "This problem is often used in interviews to test a candidate's understanding of tree traversal, recursion, and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two binary trees, and you need to determine if they are identical. Two binary trees are considered identical if:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They have the same structure (i.e., the same shape).\n",
    "2. Corresponding nodes have the same values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "As you mentioned in your discussion, Depth-First Search (DFS) is more suitable for this problem because it preserves the structure of the tree during traversal. There are two primary ways to implement DFS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursive**: Using function calls to explore each branch.\n",
    "- **Iterative**: Using a stack to simulate the recursive behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s implement the solution using DFS (recursive approach) since it is a more intuitive and cleaner solution for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you can implement the solution in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TreeNode:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "        self.left = left\n",
    "        self.right = right\n",
    "\n",
    "def is_identical(tree1, tree2):\n",
    "    # If both trees are empty, they are identical\n",
    "    if not tree1 and not tree2:\n",
    "        return True\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # If one tree is empty and the other is not, they are not identical\n",
    "    if not tree1 or not tree2:\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # If the values of the current nodes are not equal, they are not identical\n",
    "    if tree1.value != tree2.value:\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Recursively check the left and right subtrees\n",
    "    return is_identical(tree1.left, tree2.left) and is_identical(tree1.right, tree2.right)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "# Creating two identical trees\n",
    "tree1 = TreeNode(5)\n",
    "tree1.left = TreeNode(3)\n",
    "tree1.right = TreeNode(45)\n",
    "\n",
    "tree2 = TreeNode(5)\n",
    "tree2.left = TreeNode(3)\n",
    "tree2.right = TreeNode(45)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating two non-identical trees\n",
    "tree3 = TreeNode(5)\n",
    "tree3.left = TreeNode(3)\n",
    "tree3.right = TreeNode(45)\n",
    "tree3.right.left = TreeNode(10)  # Extra node\n",
    "\n",
    "print(is_identical(tree1, tree2))  # Output: True (They are identical)\n",
    "print(is_identical(tree1, tree3))  # Output: False (They are not identical)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base Case**:\n",
    "  - If both trees are `None`, they are identical.\n",
    "  - If one tree is `None` and the other is not, they are not identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursive Case**:\n",
    "  - Check if the current nodes' values are equal.\n",
    "  - Recursively compare the left subtrees and the right subtrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why DFS Works Here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preserves Structure**: By comparing corresponding nodes and their subtrees in a depth-first manner, DFS ensures that both the value and structure are considered.\n",
    "- **Simple Recursion**: The recursive approach is straightforward and naturally fits the problem, as each tree can be broken down into smaller sub-problems (i.e., comparing subtrees).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. We must visit each node once to compare the two trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursive call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using DFS (either recursively or iteratively) is an excellent way to solve this problem, as it ensures that both the structure and values of the trees are preserved and compared accurately. BFS, while useful in other contexts, doesn't naturally lend itself to maintaining the structure during traversal, which is critical for this problem."
