    "### AVL Tree Rotations: Deeper Dive into Complex Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll explore more complex rotations in AVL trees, specifically the scenario involving an **RL (Right-Left) Rotation**. This situation arises when a node becomes unbalanced due to a heavier right subtree, but within that subtree, the left child is the one causing the imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Understanding the Complex Rotation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the process step-by-step, considering the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have a node `A` with a right child `C`, and `C` has a left child `B`.\n",
    "- The subtree under `B` includes `BR` (B's right child), `CL` (C's left child), and `CR` (C's right child).\n",
    "- Our goal is to rebalance the tree when `C` is heavier on its left side (due to `B`), which makes `A` unbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Structure:**\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "     A\n",
    "      \\\n",
    "       C\n",
    "      /\n",
    "     B\n",
    "    / \\\n",
    "  BL   BR\n",
    "       \\\n",
    "       CL\n",
    "        \\\n",
    "        CR\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `C` is the right child of `A`, `B` is the left child of `C`, and `BR` is the right child of `B`. `B`'s structure makes the entire tree unbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Left Rotation on C (B Comes Up)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, perform a left rotation on `C`. This means `B` will become the parent of `C`, and `C`'s right subtree (which is `CL`) becomes `B`'s right subtree.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**After Left Rotation on C:**\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "     A\n",
    "      \\\n",
    "       B\n",
    "      / \\\n",
    "    BL   C\n",
    "         / \\\n",
    "       CL   CR\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `B` becomes the root of the subtree, and `C` moves down as the right child of `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Right Rotation on A (B Becomes the New Root)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, we perform a right rotation on `A`. Now, `B` moves up to become the root of this subtree, and `A` becomes the left child of `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Structure after Right Rotation on A:**\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "     B\n",
    "    / \\\n",
    "   A   C\n",
    "  /   / \\\n",
    "AL   CL   CR\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `AL` remains the left child of `A`, `CL` remains the left child of `C`, and `CR` remains the right child of `C`. \n",
    "- `B` now balances the tree perfectly, adhering to the AVL tree properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Review of AVL Tree Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insertion and Balancing**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insertion**: After inserting a node, you always start checking from the inserted node upwards, recalculating the balance factor at each step. If any node becomes unbalanced (balance factor not in `[-1, 0, 1]`), you perform the appropriate rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Balancing**: There are four scenarios:\n",
    "   - **LL Rotation**: Left-Left imbalance, corrected by a single right rotation.\n",
    "   - **RR Rotation**: Right-Right imbalance, corrected by a single left rotation.\n",
    "   - **LR Rotation**: Left-Right imbalance, corrected by a left rotation followed by a right rotation.\n",
    "   - **RL Rotation**: Right-Left imbalance, corrected by a right rotation followed by a left rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Deletion and Rebalancing**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deletion**: Similar to insertion, but after removing a node, you must check the balance from the point of deletion upwards. If any imbalance is detected, the appropriate rotation is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Traversal and Rotations**: Post-deletion, the same balance rules apply, and you need to check every ancestor node for balance as you traverse back to the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Time Complexity and Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: AVL trees ensure that the height of the tree remains `O(log n)`. This balance ensures that the operations (insertion, deletion, and search) all have a time complexity of `O(log n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Cases**:\n",
    "  - **Search-Heavy Applications**: AVL trees are ideal for scenarios where read operations dominate because they maintain a tighter balance than other self-balancing trees, like Red-Black Trees.\n",
    "  - **Database Indexing**: In database systems where balanced search trees are essential for quick lookup times.\n",
    "  - **In-Memory Search**: When efficient in-memory search operations are crucial, AVL trees provide guaranteed log-time complexity without degeneration into linear time, which can happen in unbalanced trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "AVL trees, with their ability to maintain balance through rotations, are powerful tools in maintaining efficient search times. The ability to correctly implement rotations (especially in more complex cases like RL and LR) is key to harnessing the power of AVL trees. Their primary trade-off is the overhead of rebalancing, making them slightly slower for insert-heavy workloads compared to Red-Black Trees, but more optimal for balanced operations and search-heavy use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding these concepts, practicing the rotations, and knowing when to apply them, you can effectively use AVL trees in various scenarios to ensure efficient data management and retrieval."
