    "# Array Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an Array?\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. The elements can be of the same type (homogeneous). Arrays are used to store data in a structured way, making it easier to manage and access.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tFixed Size: Once an array is created, its size is fixed. You cannot change its size dynamically.\n",
    "\t2.\tContiguous Memory: All elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.\n",
    "\t3.\tUniform Type: All elements in an array are of the same type.\n",
    "\t4.\tIndex-Based Access: Elements can be accessed using their index, which allows for efficient retrieval and modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Operations on Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tAccessing Elements: Accessing an element by its index is O(1) time complexity.\n",
    "\t2.\tModifying Elements: Modifying an element by its index is O(1) time complexity.\n",
    "\t3.\tInserting Elements: Inserting elements at a specific position requires shifting elements and has an average time complexity of O(n).\n",
    "\t4.\tDeleting Elements: Deleting elements also requires shifting and has an average time complexity of O(n).\n",
    "\t5.\tSearching Elements: Searching for an element has a time complexity of O(n) for linear search and O(log n) for binary search in a sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Array Data Structure in Python\n",
    "Python does not have built-in support for fixed-size arrays as in some other programming languages. Instead, Python lists are dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink in size. However, Python provides an array module to create arrays that are more like traditional arrays with fixed types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example using Python’s array module\n",
    "\n",
    "import array\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an array of integers\n",
    "arr = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access an element by index\n",
    "print(arr[0])  # Output: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify an element by index\n",
    "arr[1] = 10\n",
    "print(arr)  # Output: array('i', [1, 10, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert an element (requires shifting)\n",
    "arr.insert(2, 20)\n",
    "print(arr)  # Output: array('i', [1, 10, 20, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete an element (requires shifting)\n",
    "arr.pop(2)\n",
    "print(arr)  # Output: array('i', [1, 10, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Search for an element\n",
    "index = arr.index(10)\n",
    "print(index)  # Output: 1\n",

    "## Memory Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "In lower-level languages like C or C++, arrays are closely tied to memory addresses. Each element in the array is stored in a contiguous block of memory, and the index of an element is used to calculate its position in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in C (for understanding memory representation)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Accessing elements\n",
    "    printf(\"Element at index 0: %d\\n\", arr[0]);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Modifying elements\n",
    "    arr[1] = 10;\n",
    "    printf(\"Modified element at index 1: %d\\n\", arr[1]);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Address of elements\n",
    "    printf(\"Address of element at index 0: %p\\n\", &arr[0]);\n",
    "    printf(\"Address of element at index 1: %p\\n\", &arr[1]);\n",

    "\t1.\tLists:\n",
    "\t•\tDynamic size: Can grow and shrink as needed.\n",
    "\t•\tCan contain elements of different types.\n",
    "\t•\tMore flexible but less memory-efficient.\n",

    "\t•\tAll elements must be of the same type.\n",
    "\t•\tMore memory-efficient, especially for large numerical data.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tArrays: Fundamental data structures with fixed size, contiguous memory storage, and efficient index-based access.\n",
    "\t•\tOperations: Access, modify, insert, delete, and search.\n",
    "\t•\tMemory Efficiency: Arrays are more memory-efficient for large datasets of the same type.\n",
    "\t•\tUse Cases: Suitable for scenarios where the number of elements is known in advance and does not change frequently."

    "\t•\tBuilt-in Support: Lists are built-in data structures in Python.\n",
    "\t•\tMemory Management: Lists are more flexible but can be less memory-efficient due to their dynamic nature and ability to hold mixed types.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    # Example of a list in Python\n",
    "    list_example = [1, 2, \"three\", 4.0]\n",
    "    list_example.append(5)  # Adding an element\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrays in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tFixed Size and Type: Arrays require all elements to be of the same type and have a fixed size once created.\n",
    "\t•\tMemory Efficiency: Arrays are more memory-efficient than lists because they store elements of the same type in contiguous memory.\n",
    "\t•\tArray Module: Python provides an array module to create arrays with elements of the same type.\n",

    "### Arrays and Memory Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "In lower-level programming languages (like C), arrays are directly tied to memory addresses. This concept helps to understand how data is stored and accessed efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Memory Addresses in Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tContiguous Memory: Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, meaning all elements are stored next to each other in memory without any gaps.\n",
    "\t•\tIndex Calculation: The memory address of any element in the array can be calculated if you know the base address and the size of each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simple illustration of how arrays work at a lower level:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Simulating array behavior with memory addresses in Python\n",
    "import ctypes\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an array of integers\n",
    "arr = (ctypes.c_int * 5)(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access elements using index\n",
    "print(arr[0])  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(arr[1])  # Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Memory address of the first element\n",
    "print(ctypes.addressof(arr))  # Base address\n",
    "print(ctypes.addressof(arr) + ctypes.sizeof(arr._type_))  # Address of the second element\n",
